train the model in Keras and make a h5 model

then we will have 3 functions whether its batch or restful API

def get_model 
load_model( 'some h5  file')
return model 

def preprocessing
 return preprocessed array   ## this is usually a numpy array and you can decide how many dimensions and shape it is

def predict
   model.predict(preprocessed array)

response ()  ## this will either go to the weba pp

or in batch processing it can go to the app.

If you are web srevices then use flask and web api

##########################  AWS deployment for keras with h5 and JSON file structure

step 1: save the weights of the file as h5 over here we will call it mpg_model_weights.h5
         save the structure of the model as JSON as mpg_model.json

now we will sign to AWS  and click AWS Sagemaker::: please know that I will open my jupyter notebook inside AWS and then upload everything there

click Dashboard --> Notebook instances ---> jupyter notebook  --> now upload the file where we have been working 

-- code
import Boto3 , 
from sagemaker import get-execution_role

import keras 
from keras.models import model_from_json

--- now make a dir called keras model and upload h5 and json file there

build.savedmodelBuilder
