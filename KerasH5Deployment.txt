train the model in Keras and make a h5 model

then we will have 3 functions whether its batch or restful API

def get_model 
load_model( 'some h5  file')
return model 

def preprocessing
 return preprocessed array   ## this is usually a numpy array and you can decide how many dimensions and shape it is

def predict
   model.predict(preprocessed array)

response ()  ## this will either go to the weba pp

or in batch processing it can go to the app.

If you are web srevices then use flask and web api
